jenks natural breaks algorithm in C++

This is Tom MacWright's javascript implementation of Jenk's natural breaks algorithm ported to C++17. The Javascript itself was a port from Jenks' original Fortran, see ["Optimal Data Classification for Choropleth Maps", Jenks, 1977](https://books.google.com/books/about/Optimal_Data_Classification_for_Chorople.html?id=HvAENQAACAAJ).
 
 The original Fortran is not available online.
 Tom MacWright's code is [here](https://gist.github.com/tmcw/4977508)
 and his write-up of that code is [here](https://macwright.com/2013/02/18/literate-jenks)
